	Comments in JSON

	I removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold 
	parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability.  
	I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn't. 

	Suppose you are using JSON to keep configuration files, which you would like 
	to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it 
	through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser.

	// Hot diggity dawng!  Comments in JSON used in the use case mentioned by its 
	// author.

	// Hot diggity indeed.
